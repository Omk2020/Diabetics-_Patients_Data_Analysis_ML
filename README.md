Overview

This project focuses on developing a system for predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. The solution involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, followed by building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard is used for visualizing key insights and metrics from the data.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and distributions.
Machine Learning Modeling: Built and evaluated various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
Power BI Dashboard: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize data insights and model predictions.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identified the most significant features influencing diabetes prediction.
